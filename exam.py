# Write a program that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a dictionary. It doesn’t matter what the 
# values are. Then you can use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary.
# find = open('main.txt')
# wrd = dict()
# for line in find:
#     words = line.split()
#     if len(words) < 1:
#         continue
#     for word in words:
#         wrd[word] = ''
# print(wrd)
